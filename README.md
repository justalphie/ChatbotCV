# ChatbotCV
You can ask this chatbot questions about my resume. Use this [link!](https://huggingface.co/spaces/justalphie/ChatbotCV)

The chatbot is built using Cohere Chat, and the data comes from the `prompt.md` file.

## Description
The chatbot uses [Cohere's Command model](https://cohere.com/command) and displays the results using [Gradio interface](https://www.gradio.app/guides/creating-a-chatbot-fast).

## Development steps
The chatbot uses the ```prompt.md``` file as a prompt. It contains the instructions to the model as well as the resume of the candidate.

The ```convert_history``` function takes a prompt and adds it to history. It also converts Gradio's input message and chat history structure into the structure accepted by Cohere's model.

The ```reply``` function takes the chat history and user's input as arguments, and streams the answer of the model. 

Finally, the chatbot is launched. 
```
gr.ChatInterface(reply,
    title="Alfiya's Curriculum Vitae",
    description=description
).launch()
``` 

To host the ChatbotCV [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) were used.


## Configuration
If you would like to create a similar chatbot for your own CV, you will need to make an account on Cohere and HuggingFace, define the Key for your Cohere Client as a system variable on your own computer.
